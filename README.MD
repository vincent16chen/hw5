I had create a music player. The idea of design's look is come from Sony walkman CD player. There is 3 buttons for interct, which play, next song, and stop. 
By click play, it will start playin song 1 - FIESTA from KPOP group IZ*ONE. 
Click next, it will play Red Velvet - Psycho, which are also Kpop song.
Click stop, will stop all the action including animation in the background.
